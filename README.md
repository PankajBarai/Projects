# **Welcome to My Project....**
## **1)  Exploratory_Data_Analysis_on_Netflix_Movies_and_TV_Shows.**

****Exploratory Data Analysis?****  
Exploratory data analysis (EDA for short) is what data analysts do with large sets of data, looking for patterns and summarizing the dataset’s main characteristics beyond what they learn from modeling and hypothesis testing.  
EDA is a philosophy that allows data analysts to approach a database without assumptions.  
When a data analyst employs EDA, it’s like they’re asking the data to tell them what they don’t know.  
It is an approach to data analysis, that uses these techniques:
   - Maximize insights into a dataset.  
   - Uncover underlying structures.  
   - Extract important variables.  
   - Detect outliers and anomalies.  
   - Test underlying assumptions.  
   - Determine optimal factor settings.  


Dataset is available on Kaggle [link](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows).  
It contains information about the NetFlix movies and TV shows.It includes the information about type of the movie,title	of the movie, director name,	cast,	country,date_added,	release_year,rating of the movie, duration,	listed_in and descriptionthe.  
We will analyze this dataset and draw some conclusions.

## **2)  Predict Employee Attrition using Classification Algorithms.**  
**Problem Statement :**  
Uncover the factors that lead to employee attrition and explore the reasons as to why people are leaving the organization and predict whether an employee will leave the organization or not by creating a Web App using Streamlit that takes inputs from user's online.

## **3)  Unsupervised Learning (Customer Market Segmentation).**  
**Problem Statement:**  
You have been hired as a Data Scientist and have to perform Customer Market Segementation which will help the bank's marketing team to launch a targetted marketing ad campaign that is tailored to a specific group of customers.  
In simple words, the bank wants to divide their customers into atleast different groups for the ad-campaign to be successful.  
This process is called **Market Segmentation** and it is crucial for maximizing marketing campaign conversion rate.  
****Aim:****  
you have to build a clustering model to divide customer's into  distinctive groups.

## **4) Facial Emotion Recognition using CNN.**   
Facial expressions are one of the ways humans communicate. Deep learning approaches in human and computer interactions are used in artificial intelligence research as an effective system application process. The detection of emotions or facial expressions in psychology necessitates the examination and evaluation of decisions in anticipating a person's feelings or a group of people communicating. This study proposes the development of a system that can predict and recognize the classification of facial emotions using the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) algorithm and feature extraction. 

Data preprocessing, facial feature extraction, and facial emotion classification are the three key steps in the notebook. Facial expressions were predicted with the accuracy of <span style="color:crimson;">62.66</span> percent with using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This algorithm was evaluated on a publicly available dataset from the <span style="color:crimson;">FER2013</span> database, which has 35887 48x48 grayscale face images each representing one of the emotions.
