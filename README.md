# **Welcome to My Project....**
**1)  Exploratory_Data_Analysis_on_Netflix_Movies_and_TV_Shows.**

****Exploratory Data Analysis?****  
Exploratory data analysis (EDA for short) is what data analysts do with large sets of data, looking for patterns and summarizing the dataset’s main characteristics beyond what they learn from modeling and hypothesis testing.  
EDA is a philosophy that allows data analysts to approach a database without assumptions.  
When a data analyst employs EDA, it’s like they’re asking the data to tell them what they don’t know.  
It is an approach to data analysis, that uses these techniques:
   - Maximize insights into a dataset.  
   - Uncover underlying structures.  
   - Extract important variables.  
   - Detect outliers and anomalies.  
   - Test underlying assumptions.  
   - Determine optimal factor settings.  


Dataset is available on Kaggle [link](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows).  
It contains information about the NetFlix movies and TV shows.It includes the information about type of the movie,title	of the movie, director name,	cast,	country,date_added,	release_year,rating of the movie, duration,	listed_in and descriptionthe.  
We will analyze this dataset and draw some conclusions.

****Libraries used:**** Pandas, Numpy , Matplotlib, Seaborn , Ploty, Wordcloud....

**2)  Predict Employee Attrition using Classification Algorithms.**  
**Problem Statement :**  
Uncover the factors that lead to employee attrition and explore the reasons as to why people are leaving the organization and predict whether an employee will leave the organization or not by creating a Web App using Streamlit that takes inputs from user's online.  

****Libraries used :****  
Pandas,Numpy,Matplotlib,Seaborn,Plotly,Sidetable,Pandas_Profiling,LabelEncoder, StandardScaler
train_test_split , GridSearchCV.    
****ML Algorithm used :**** LogisticRegression, SVC, KNeighborsClassifier, GaussianNB, DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier.  
****Deployed :**** Streamlit.
